ROCOM is a system of software applications that analyses motorcycle motion and mapped out risky road sections.

The system consists of three major components, i.e. 1. ROCOM Data Logger app, which utilizes a smart phone to collect acceleration data, geolocation, date and time. 2. ROCOM Risk Mapping app, which is a web-based application. 3. ROCOM Visual Tracking, which is a stand alone software to review the footage of location that has adverse acceleration value.
